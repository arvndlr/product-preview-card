## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I strengthen here my understanding about CSS flexbox and grid.

```css
.product {
    max-width: 343px;
    max-height: 100%;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    border-radius: 10px;
    background-color: var(--surface);
    border-radius: 0.5em;
  }
```

### Continued development

Next time I want to focus more on accurate responsive design
